**#Social Media App**
The App serves as a bsic social media website where a user can post content and view the posts of all users
First the user should register in the Register page
Once registered he/she will get redirected to the home page
In Home page on top we have Header. Header has website logo, signout button, and profile image
In the next section the home page has upload content section. Here we can upload images using choose file input and upload button.
Next there will be a list of scrollable post where all the user posts are visible
In the header using signout user can signout from website and get directed to login page
In the login page we can enter email and password to sign back in


**#Technologies**
The app is built using React JS, HTML, CSS, and third party packages like react-router-dom for routing, js-cookie for local storage, react-icons for icons
I have used firebase for User Authentication, Storage of posts, and Hosting of my website
